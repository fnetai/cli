# @fnet/cli Repository

This is the main implementation repository for the Flownet CLI.

## Relationship with Knowledge Repository

This repository (@fnet/cli) and the knowledge repository have a symbiotic, iterative relationship:

1. **@fnet/cli → knowledge**: The codebase here serves as the primary source for creating comprehensive documentation in the knowledge repository. By deeply understanding the implementation, architecture, and patterns in this codebase, high-quality documentation and guides are added to the knowledge repository.

2. **knowledge → @fnet/cli**: As the knowledge repository evolves with better documentation, insights, and best practices, it informs and improves the codebase here. Better documentation leads to better code design and implementation.

This creates a virtuous cycle: better code leads to better documentation, which leads to better code.

## Key Points

- Focus on clean, well-structured implementation
- Code patterns and architecture here should be documented in the knowledge repository
- Insights from knowledge documentation should guide refactoring and improvements here
