# Phase X: [Phase Name]

## Objective

[Brief description of what this phase aims to accomplish]

## Phase Type

Choose one:

- **Implementation Phase**: Adds minimal working functionality to the system
- **Research Phase**: Research-only phase that informs future development

## Approach

**REMEMBER: The primary purpose is to add valuable features and components to the Flownet CLI application if a phase is an Implementation Phase.**

**IMPORTANT: Start with the absolute minimum viable implementation. Keep it simple!**

For Implementation Phases:

1. Focus on core functionality only
2. Implement the simplest solution that works
3. Avoid premature optimization or complex structures
4. Skip nice-to-have features for later phases

For Research Phases:

1. Research the core concepts thoroughly
2. First check `./research/index.md` to understand the research directory structure
3. Document findings in the research directory following existing patterns
4. Focus on practical applications relevant to our system
5. Provide clear recommendations for implementation

## Checklist
